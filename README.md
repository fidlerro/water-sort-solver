The **Water Sort Puzzle** is a popular mobile game that challenges players to sort colored water in a set of tubes. The goal is to arrange the water in such a way that each tube contains a single color. The game starts with a set of tubes, each containing a mixture of colored water in varying quantities. Your task is to move the water from one tube to another in a way that eventually separates the colors.

### Additional Functionality ###
* **Screenshot Uploads** - This feature allows players to quickly and effortlessly capture screenshots of their current game state within the app. It is designed for ease of use, enabling players to preserve game moments or progress instantly without needing to navigate away from the game interface.
* **Screenshot Cropping** - With the integration of the [Cropper.js framework](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/), this tool offers users an intuitive and flexible way to select the exact game area they wish to analyze or solve from their uploaded screenshot. Cropper.js enhances the user experience by providing a smooth, interactive cropping interface, allowing for precise adjustments and real-time feedback. This ensures that only the relevant portions of the game are processed, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the AI Image Recognition and Water Sort Solver functionalities.
* **AI Image Recognition** - Powered by the [TensorFlow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/), this feature employs state-of-the-art AI algorithms to convert cropped screenshots into a simplified JSON data structure. It adeptly recognizes and categorizes the game's various elements and colors, translating complex visual information into a computationally friendly format. This integration of TensorFlow not only enhances the accuracy of image recognition but also ensures the application remains at the forefront of AI technology, providing a robust foundation for processing and analyzing game data.
* **Water Sort Puzzle Solver** - This pivotal feature ingests the JSON data structure, representing the game's current state, to formulate a strategic, step-by-step solution for the Water Sort Puzzle. It outputs the solution in both a visual representation and a textual format, catering to diverse user preferences. Special thanks to the original work by [Ruslan Kurdyumov](https://www.ruslankurdyumov.com/about-me.html), which served as a foundational reference in developing this enhanced version of the Water Sort Puzzle Solver. This acknowledgment highlights the collaborative spirit of the development community and the solver's commitment to building upon proven methodologies to offer users a comprehensive and efficient solving tool.
* **Mobile-Friendly Interface** - Utilizing the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/), this web application is meticulously designed to offer seamless integration across both PC and mobile devices. The responsive design ensures that all functionalities, including screenshot uploads, cropping, and the solver itself, adapt elegantly to different screen sizes and orientations. This approach guarantees an optimal user experience, making the application accessible and easy to use regardless of the device.
